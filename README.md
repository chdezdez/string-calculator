# Arithmetic String Calculator

ASC is a linux commandline program used for making quick arithmethic operations.

## Why would this even exist?

Personally, I'm not a quick thinker when it comes to arithmetic. Sometimes, I need to use my phone calculator app, but I think is not fast enough as typing with a
keyboard. While web browsers already do this, opening the browser or creating a new page might cost a little of time. So, I like it, and also, the purpose of this
project is to learn git/github and to have a excuse to program.

# Usage

Currently, this project is empty. But I want to make something like this:

´´´bash
asc 10 * 20 - 4 / 4 + sqrt(25)
result: 204
´´´
